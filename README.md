# AxH

This is planned to be a long term project with Vulkan written in C++. The goal is to create somewhat of a framework that can later be used comfortably to create smaller/simpler games. It is planned to support Windows & Ubuntu.

It uses:

GLM library
GLFW
It uses the dep_inc folder for any includes necessary for the libraries used.
It uses the lib folder for any binarys necessary.

Refer to the README.md files in the directiories dep_inc and lib for more information
